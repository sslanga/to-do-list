My-To-Do-List
This is a simple, responsive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks seamlessly.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks using the input field and "Add" button.
Edit Tasks: Users can edit tasks, updating the content directly within the task item.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks using the "Delete" button next to each item.
Responsive UI: Clean and centered UI with flexible styles for an easy user experience.

Code Structure
HTML
The HTML file contains the structure for the to-do list application:

Container: Holds the main list, input field, and buttons.
Input Field: Allows the user to type a task to be added to the list.
Buttons:
"Add" button to add tasks to the list.
"Edit" and "Delete" buttons for each task item, providing editing and deletion options.
<div class="container">
  <h1>My-To-Do-List</h1>
  <input type="text" id="myToDo" placeholder="insert here">
  <button id="myButton">Add</button>
  <ol id="listItems"></ol>
</div>

CSS
The CSS provides a clean, centered layout with a light background and box shadow for the container:

Body: Sets up a centered layout with a neutral background.
Container: Styled with padding, rounded corners, and a box shadow.
Task Items: Each item is styled as a rounded box with a margin and padding.
Buttons: Separate styles for the "Delete" button to stand out and the "Edit" button to match the layout.


JavaScript
The JavaScript manages task creation, deletion, and editing:

Event Listeners:

Listens for "Add" button clicks to add a new task.
Listens for "Delete" button clicks to remove a task.
Listens for "Edit" button clicks to modify a task.

Functions:

createTask(taskText): Generates a new task item with text content and appends it to the list.
Editing: When "Edit" is clicked, an input field replaces the task text, allowing users to modify it. A "Save" button appears to confirm changes.
Deleting: When "Delete" is clicked, the task item is removed from the list.

Future Improvements
"Enter" Key Support: Allow users to press "Enter" to add tasks instead of requiring a button click.
Task Sorting: Add functionality to rearrange tasks by priority or due date.
Persistent Storage: Store tasks in local storage so they remain after the page is reloaded.

Simply open index.html in any modern web browser to use the to-do list application.
